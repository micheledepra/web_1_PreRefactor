### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Scenarios**: Pre-defined test cases for different combat situations
- **Dice Combinations**: Tests for 1v1, 2v1, 3v1, 3v2 dice combinations
- **Combat Patterns**: Tests for single and multiple attack patterns
- **Conquest Tests**: Tests for different army movement amounts after conquest
- **Mock Objects**: Non-destructive testing without affecting actual game state

## User Interface Components

- **Event-Based Communication**: Components communicate through events
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features degrade gracefully on lower-end devices

### Performance Considerations
- **Dynamic Quality Scaling**: Adjusts based on device capabilities
- **Batched Animation Updates**: Reduces DOM reflows and repaints
- **Audio Pooling**: Pre-loads and reuses audio resources
- **Lazy Initialization**: Components initialize only when needed

### Future Improvements
- **Animation Presets**: Allow users to create custom animation styles
- **Extended Statistics**: Track more detailed combat metrics
- **Multi-battle View**: Visualize statistics across multiple games
- **Achievement System**: Reward players for combat milestones
